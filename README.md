## About Dapr

Dapr is a tool that simplifies microservice connectivity. It handles all the complex activities regarding microservice management, allowing developers to focus on business logic.

## Publisher & Subscriber Test
  
One of the many applications of Dapr is message handling. This means that one service can publish a message to a queue and another can subscribe to this queue and understand the message. All of this is handled by the Dapr sidecar and configured simply using one .yaml file.
